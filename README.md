# Oystercard Challenge

Your task is to build an Oyster Card command line app using the below user stories as guidance. This should really stretch your skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

<dl>
  <dt>I write code that is easy to change</dt>
  <dd>Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.</dd>
  <dt>I can test-drive my code</dt>
  <dd>Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.</dd>
  <dt>I can build with objects</dt>
  <dd>Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.</dd>
